# JPacman-framework

## Getting started with this project

1. Fork this repository into the organization _INFOM124-Verification-et-Validation_ (be careful not to fork it on your _own_ profile!).
2. To see JPacman in action, run `nl.tudelft.jpacman.Launcher` in IntelliJ
3. To run the test suite in maven, run `mvn clean test`. If you want to use the maven wrapper, use `./mvnw clean test` on Linux or MacOS or `mvnw.cmd clean test` on Windows.
4. See the different `.md` files for the exercises instructions.
5. Enjoy !

## How to work on the project ? Comment Ã§a marche ???

Each student will work on a fork repository of [INFOM124-STUDENTS](https://github.com/INFOM124-Verification-et-Validation/INFOM124-STUDENTS). We expect you to follow some best software engineering practices during the courses:

- **Answer each exercise on a dedicated git branch** of your fork repository.
- **Make sure you commit frequently** for each exercise, possibly more than once per exercise
- **Write clear commit messages**: your commit messages should serve as a summary of the changes you made.
- **When you are satisfied with your implementation of an exercise, make a pull request (PR) on the main branch of your repository** (not the upstream repository !). Avoid committing to master directly, this is a bad practice in most of the cases.
- **You can ask for students to review your code** changes before merging to your main branch. Following the best practices on you work will help your reviewers to understand what you're trying to do in your PR.

## How can we improve this course ?
