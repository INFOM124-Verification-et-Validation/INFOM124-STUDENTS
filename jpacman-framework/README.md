# JPacman-framework

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository into the organization _INFOM124-Verification-et-Validation_ (be careful not to fork it on your own profile!).
2. To see JPacman in action, run `nl.tudelft.jpacman.Launcher` in IntelliJ
3. To run the test suite in maven, run `mvn clean test`. If you want to use the maven wrapper, use `./mvnw clean test` on Linux or MacOS or `mvnw.cmd clean test` on Windows.
4. See the different `.md` files for the exercises instructions.
5. Enjoy !

## Revision control

Each student will work on the codebase on a forked repository of [INFOM124-STUDENTS](https://github.com/INFOM124-Verification-et-Validation/INFOM124-STUDENTS). We expect you to follow these best practices during the courses:

- **Make sure you commit frequently**: commit at least once, but possibly more often per exercise!
- **Write clear commit messages**: your commit messages should serve as a summary of the changes you made.
- **Use branches**: you'll get most benefit from git if you also use branches, for example one branch for every exercise.
- **Use pull requests and avoid committing to master directly.**

Each pull request will be reviewed by another student before merging into main. Following the best practices on your work will help the reviewer to make a good review of your work.
